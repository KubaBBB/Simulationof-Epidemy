# Simulationof-Epidemy

Implementation of epidemy simulation.

Simulation of the spread of the epidemic. During the next iterations you can see outbreaks of the epidemic. 
Several states of cellular machines are distinguished. 
Possibility to edit parameters: grid size - to optimize the time. 
In order to speed up the optimization, enable in non-debug mode.

python 3.0, needed Anaconda - and installed numpy, numba
